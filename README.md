# Python-Automation-Project
This is my Automation Project developed with Python


The idea here is to add as much functionality to this software that interacts with your PC in automating mouse actions and movements. 

The plan:

1) Count mouse strokes, distance travelled on your trackpad. (eventually count keystrokes from the Keyboard)
2) Log your actions in a spreadsheet (may need to learn SQL)
3) Record actions to automate
